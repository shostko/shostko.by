Project contains 2 applications - the client's part `Beam Cube` is based on the Raspberry Pi 3 model B, connected to the Pico projector which will take a feed (timeline) from social networks (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat) using wifi and show it on the wall using the Pico projector. 

The second application is the `Beam Companion`, which provide users with the ability to log in to social networks, setup scrolling speed, social networks credentials, and WIFI connection credentials and transfer all this data to Beam Cube using direct WiFi connection.
