Innovative educational application. It works by turning the core syllabus (Math, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, English, History and Geography) into easy to remember ‘hooks’. These hooks get stuck in your head just like the lyrics of a song. This helps the retention and recollection. What’s more you can test yourself in-app to see just how much you can recall.
