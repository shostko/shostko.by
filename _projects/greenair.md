Fresh Air is an app to actively support the proper ventilation of apartments and houses to improve the indoor climate and possible premature detection of moisture problems indoors. Persistently high humidity can be an indication of mold growth. Identified early problems with moisture can avoid or reduce health problems and reduce repair costs.
