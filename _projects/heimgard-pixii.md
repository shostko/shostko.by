Pixii Home is a mobile app that lets you monitor and manage your home battery & solar energy system right from your phone. You can track real-time energy production, usage, storage, and see solar generation as well as grid import/export. The app offers smart control modes—like adaptive peak shaving, maximizing solar self-consumption, or manual control—to optimize how stored energy is used. It also provides visual insights with charts and history so you can understand your energy habits and make smarter choices to reduce electricity bills or use more renewable power.
