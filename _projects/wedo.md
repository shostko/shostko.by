Uvents is a social calendar platform designed specifically for universities to centralize and manage student events. It brings together all events hosted by clubs, societies, and campus organizations into one secure calendar accessible only by students, helping eliminate scattered event listings and external links. The app supports event creation, discussion forums for clubs, and ticketing within the platform itself. Uvents also prioritizes privacy, giving students control over who sees their activity and profile, and lets users save memories of events into personal albums.
